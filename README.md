Scrawler is a character frequency analysis tool, meticulously programmed in the C language. It offers a unique solution for analyzing text documents by calculating and graphing the frequency of each letter within a given text file. The tool identifies the most repeated character, providing insights into the data's character composition.

Developed as a foundational project in the first semester of an engineering program, Scrawler is the collaborative result of Arun Chandra Bhusal, also known on GitHub as Sharp As Wedge. This project showcases the practical application of programming knowledge to solve real-world problems.

Features:

    Histogram for Character Frequency: Visualize the count of each alphabet character from the text file in a clear and concise histogram.
    Highlight Most Repeated Character: Automatically discerns and reports the character with the highest frequency.
    Text File Input: Easily ingest any .txt file for processing.
    Optimized Performance: Fast and efficient analysis, even with extensive text files.

Usage:

    Download the Scrawler code to your local system.
    Use a C compiler to compile Scrawler.c into an executable file.
    Execute the program, providing the text file you wish to analyze as the argument.
    Review the histogram output and take note of the most frequently occurring character as reported by the program.
